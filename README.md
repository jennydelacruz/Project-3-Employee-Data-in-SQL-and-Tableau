# SQL-and-Tableau-Project-3
In this project, as part of Udemy's Business Intelligence course, I have queried a fictional employee database containing over 135,000 records, using MySQL workbench. 

Querying the database, I have applied aggregations, inner joins, cross joins and stored procedures to solve the required four tasks. 

Additionally, I created relevant visualizations in Tableau using the output of the four requested tasks to create a business dashboard.
